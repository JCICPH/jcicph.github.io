##Jenkins CI State of the Union
{: #state_of_union}

#### Keynote
 
######[Kohsuke Kawaguchi](/speakers#kohsuke), CloudBees

In the state of union keynote for Jenkins, Kohsuke will go over where the community is today and introduce various current efforts in the community to show where the development is happening. The topic includes workflow, docker integration, user interface improvements, chef/puppet integration, quality improvement effort, and so on.


## Two for One
{: #two_for_one}

#### Building Resilient CI Infrastructure and Introducing Workflow	

######[Kohsuke Kawaguchi](/speakers#kohsuke), CloudBees

Come to our show where Kohsuke talks about what CloudBees is adding to Jenkins. The first part of the talk is about the challenges of deploying, operating and using large-scale Jenkins installations, and what we are doing to help those users succeed. In particular, I'll demo how Jenkins Operations Center by CloudBees helps organizations scale Jenkins horizontally. The second part of the talk is about the workflow plugin we are building in open-source, and how it drastically simplifies dealing with complex orchestration such as the continuous delivery pipeline. I'll show you how this offers both the flexibility and the simplicity, and where we plan to take this in this year.

## Pretested Integration in Jenkins CI
{: #pretested_integration}

#### Using a "Branchy Approach"

######[Lars Kruse](/speakers#kruse), Praqma

######[Per-Arnold Blåsmo](/speakers#blaasmo), Atmel

Our newest Jenkins plugin represent distilled lessons learned in the field of continuos and automated integration. In close collaboration Praqma and Atmel have developed a generic plugin offering one-click support for pretested integration in Distributed Version Control Systems such as Mercurial and Git. We will present this "branchy approach" to pre-tested integration and argue why we have come to believe that this approach is preferable over alternatives frequently being used by other technologies. We will touch on the impressive journey Atmel is taking and present the automated workflow strategy already implemented at Atmel in their _all-Atlassian-except-Jenkins_ tool stack based on ten simple principles and the [pretested integration plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Pretested+Integration+Plugin).

## Using Jenkins as a Component
{: #jci_as_component}

###### [Jonas Bovin](/speakers#bovin), Vitec ALOC

With the 'Parameterized Build' plugin a build could suddenly be much more than just the newest build - it enables a Jenkins job to do anything. The solid handling of jobs, logs, integration to SCM systems and slaves are immensely powerful. The presentation will show how Vitec ALOC has built a small set of Java classes communicating with Jenkins via the API to harness the power of Jenkins from their existing tools. 

-Yes, the presentation will show code too!

## The Butler and the Snake
{: #butler_snake}

#### Continuous Integration for Python

###### [Timo Stollenwerk](/speakers#stollenwerk), Plone Foundation

Plone is a Python-based enterprise content management system and is among the top 2% of all Open Source projects worldwide. It is developed by a distributed team of 340 core developers using Jenkins as a centerpiece of the development and release process. This talk will present how the Plone community uses Jenkins to build, test, and deliver Python-based software projects.

## What is your next step in Continuous Delivery?
{: #next_step}

###### [Adriaan de Jonge](/speakers#de_jonge), XebiaLabs

Regardless of where you are in Continuous Delivery, you can take it one step further. There is always an option to do it just a bit faster, cheaper or better. This presentation will take you on a tour from a situation where nothing is automated, all the way to an ideal form of continuous deployment. For the impatient, the presentation concludes with a recipe to take 5 steps at a time. You can go from 0 to 60 mph in 2 seconds.

This presentation describes a vision and steps that a company can grow in Continuous Delivery. Continuous Integration – which is most often implemented using Jenkins – is a central and vital component in this vision. See the place of Jenkins in this CD architecture, where it can be used in its strength. The presentation will show where you could use Jenkins, because Jenkins can basically do anything, but it is not necessarily the best tool available. And finally, it will reveal where you actually should use Jenkins, in places the audience may not have expected and where it is the right and appropriate tool – for example in Automated Provisioning / Infrastructure as Code.
