With more than 77,000 active installations and 875 plugins Jenkins CI continues to be the world'sâ€™ leading Open Source continuous integration server. 

##This event is relevant to:
IT executives & managers, software architects & developers, project managers, agile coaches, system administrators - and everyone who's got DevOps at heart.

The Jenkins CI User Event brings together current as well as soon-to-be Jenkins users to network and harness inspiration from peers. The program will consist of invited and contributed speaks, tech talks, case stories, and facilitated Open Space discussions on theory and application of continuous integration and agile development with Jenkins. Throughout the day there will be plenty of time for relaxed social as well as professional interaction and to get into rewarding discussions with your Jenkins peers.

This is a User Community Event, and in order to accommodate feedback from the two previous years, we have made some changes. All speaks - including those from sponsors - have to go through our call for papers process and we have adopted the [TED commandments](/agenda/cfp.html). We encourage enthusiastic and engaged speakers to submit papers and we encourage companies to take a look at our community sponsorships which - besides the good karma and recognition - gives you five seats both at the conference and the code camp!

The event is a unique chance to meet experienced Jenkins CI developers, community frontrunners, executives, and others who are engaged in building quality software and accelerating the delivery process through continuous integration.
