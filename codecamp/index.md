#Jenkins CI Code Camp 2014 
__August 21st, 2014 at Praqmaplex__

######In the spirit of the Jenkins CI community we will once again kick off the Jenkins CI User Event 2014 with the annual Jenkins CI Code Camp the day prior to the User Event. This full day community driven event has become one of our most popular events, where Jenkins peers band together to contribute content back to the community.

__The format of the Code Camp__ is inspired by Open Space Technology where focus is dictated by constituency, which secures high levels of active participation from attendees.

__Bring your own topics__ - prior to the Code Camp we will contact attendees and make a "call for topics". The different topic suggestions will all be added to a backlog and at the Code Camp we will simply cast votes to find the most popular ones. Then we split out into smaller groups and work with these topics in timeboxed sessions.

__The Code Camp is open__ to both developers with prior Jenkins CI development experience as well as developers with some Java experience who are impatient to get started and want an intraveineuse shot of Jenkins - that's it! You don't have to have a lot of ideas yourself in order to participate. We guarantee a lot of interesting topics and each session will have an designated facilitator. Very efficient and very fun!

The venue will be PraqmaPlex, our own facilities, which will provide cozy souroundings. In order to secure optimal surroundings for the camp, seats are limited to 35 - so if you wanna go, don't hesitate!.

Last year the Code Camp featured skilled programmers from Praqma, CloudBees, Switch::Gears, Sony Mobile and Master students from Copenhagen University, Dept. of Computer Science, as well as the founding father of Jenkins, Kohsuke Kawaguchi and community frontrunner Jesse Glick. This year we are expecting the same crowd as well as many more.  

The Code Camp will have food, drinks, great company and of course â€“ a lot of Jenkins CI!

Sign up and stay tuned for more details on this day of Jenkins CI coding to remember!
