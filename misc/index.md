## Conference concept<br/>

The Copenhagen Jenkins User Event is focusing on gathering both current and soon-to-be users and developers of the Jenkins Continuous Integration server from all over Scandinavia to meet and get inspired by like minded peers and the presentations from community frontrunners as well as everyday Jenkins users.

To accommodate everyone, the program is constructed by a mix of presentations, tech-talks, user stories, workshops, birds-of-a-feather sessions, and facilitated Open Space discussions. Throughout the day there will be plenty of opportunity to network and get into rewarding discussions with Jenkins peers. In short, the JCICPH seeks to provide a venue for stakeholders within the Jenkins CI community to meet other people and companies who are equally engaged in Continuous Delivery and Continuous Integration with Jenkins and make valuable connections for the future.

**Catering**<br/>
Lunch, drinks and snacks are served on-site throughout the day.


**How to find by car and where to park at University of Copenhagen**<br/>
There is easy access to the August Krogh Institute from the highway system around Copenhagen and Malmø, and good parking conditions at the institute. We have arranged for parking tickets for attendees, which can be found at the registration counter upon arrival. When arriving from outside the Copenhagen area, follow the signs to København N (Copenhagen North). You may find it inconvenient to travel by car in the central part of Copenhagen.

###### The  Jenkins CI Code Camp

Each year, in conjunction with the JCICPH, Praqma also arranges The Jenkins CI Community Code Camp. It's always on the day before the User Event and has become one of our most popular events, where Jenkins peers band together to contribute content back to the community. Often the Code Camp is visited by community celebs - so is a great opportunity to “code with the stars”.
The intended audience for Code Camp is both experienced Jenkins developers and developers who are looking at getting started with Jenkins plugin development.
